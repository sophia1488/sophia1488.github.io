# About Me
* Hi! I'm Yi-Hui Chou (周奕慧). I am currently pursuing Bachelor's Degree in National Taiwan University (NTU), majoring in Electrical Engineering (EE) since 2017.
* A member of the "Speech Processing and Machine Learning Laboratory", working with Prof. [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/).
* A part-time research assistant at [Music and AI Lab](https://musicai.citi.sinica.edu.tw/), Academia Sinica since 2020
* Alongside my interests in speech processing, I'm a classical music lover. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU4iPHfb2tI&list=PLWxD9JBT-P09TzTE_kozSU4TOXfiVPGTA&index=11), my friends and I perform Mendelssohn's Piano Trio No. 1, and I'm the one who plays the piano!

# Research Experience
* Speech Processing and Machine Learning Laboratory, National Taiwan University
  * Explore self-supervised reconstruction-based model, [TERA](https://github.com/andi611/Self-Supervised-Speech-Pretraining-and-Representation-Learning)  
  * Apply this model on [Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2017](https://zerospeech.com/2017/), which targets the self-supervised discovery of linguistic units from raw speech 
  * Discover that the second hidden layer used for speech representation performs the best, while researchers typically use the last hidden layer 
  * The model we apply generalizes well across languages, indicating the potential of unsupervised pre-training methods for languages with few linguistic resources 
* Music and AI Laboratory, Academia Sinica 

# Work Experience
* Summer software intern at Ganzin Technology (2020)
  * Build a voice and eye-gaze controlled IoT device with AWS Alexa voice service and Ganzin’s eye tracking solution [ [repo](https://github.com/sophia1488/Voice-and-Eye-Gaze-Controlled-Light) ]
  * Design and implement a new feature, brightness adjustment, in addition to the required project ahead of time 
  * Refine the algorithm and improve user experience and stability by reducing latency by at best 60% 
* Summer software intern at Moxa Inc. (2019)
  * Study network intrusion detection system (Snort) for their future product design 
  * Analyze the efficiency and memory usage by simulating an intrusion environment 

# Service and Leadership
